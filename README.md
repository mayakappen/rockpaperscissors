ROCK PAPER SCISSORS!

This repo is for a basic webpage that allows the user to play a game of rock paper scissors against an AI. Wins are tallied on the left side for people and the right side for the computer. A feature of choosing different AIs with different preferences for their pick will be added if main features are completed on time (some being more likely to choose rock, some being less likely to choose scissors, etc).

Here is an image of the basic layout and color palette:
