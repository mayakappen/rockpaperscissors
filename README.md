<h3>Reflections:</h3>

Overall I'm happy with the final result. I would have liked to have a bit more time to finish making the layout a bit cleaner. I wasted a lot of time writing script that was functional but not DRY. I could have saved some time if I properly read the instructions and rubric first instead of rushing to get a working project. I had to do a LOT of refactoring with the javascript and it makes me feel like I didn't get to focus enough on the layout. I wish I followed a more consistant commit schedule and pull request format but by the end of it I feel like I got into the hang of it. I also should have probably reached out for help more as I only talked to my mentor one time throughout this project and that was it. I learned a ton about class to class interaction and parameter passiong as well as bracket notation and dom manipualtion based on a data model. I'm excited to hear what you think!
